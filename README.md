Convert Any Smart Contract To Agentic Actions

- üç≥Egg Dev Team, 2025 @ Coinbase Onchain AI Hackathon

## Overview

Nowadays, developers need to do extensive work beyond writing smart contracts to develop a complete product. Furthermore, it is challenging for end users to understand the functionality of smart contracts, let alone interact with them directly. Building upon the recent release of Coinbase AgentKit framework, we introduce **Contract2Action (C2A)**, an advanced agentic experience that converts any Ethereum smart contract into an interactive agent tool. With C2A:
- **Developers** can focus solely on smart contract development while effortlessly transforming their contracts into complete products. 
- **End users** without Web3 background can easily perform on-chain operations using natural language. 

C2A delivers a comprehensive solution encompassing UI, documentation, backend development, Web3 integration, and AI capabilities. Through seamless integration with leading Web3 and AI solutions such as Coinbase, C2A not only showcases how AI can revolutionize Web3 experiences but also serves as an indispensable toolbox for all smart contract developers.
