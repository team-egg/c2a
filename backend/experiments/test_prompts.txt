How much of my token can 0xb6cE7b211D80442b0E5A689fCe34892FF46829c1 spend? I mean, that address spends my token. You can retrieve my wallet address by tools.
It's incorrect. You can call decimals() function. Convert that to human readable amount.
Now approve 1e-6 this token to 0xb6cE7b211D80442b0E5A689fCe34892FF46829c1. It's approve, not transfer!!
