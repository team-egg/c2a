The USDTToken contract is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard, representing a stablecoin called Tether USD (USDT). It allows for the creation, transfer, and management of tokens, including functionalities for minting and burning tokens. The contract includes ownership control, allowing only the owner to mint new tokens and manage ownership.

Functions:
constructor(string,string,uint256): Initializes the USDTToken contract with a name, symbol, and total supply. | Prerequisites: None.
getOwner(): Returns the address of the current owner of the contract. | Prerequisites: None.
decimals(): Returns the number of decimal places the token uses. | Prerequisites: None.
symbol(): Returns the symbol of the token. | Prerequisites: None.
name(): Returns the name of the token. | Prerequisites: None.
totalSupply(): Returns the total supply of the token. | Prerequisites: None.
balanceOf(address): Returns the balance of a specific account. | Prerequisites: None.
transfer(address,uint256): Transfers tokens from the caller's account to a specified recipient. | Prerequisites: The caller must have a balance of at least the amount being transferred, and the recipient cannot be the zero address.
allowance(address,address): Returns the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of an owner. | Prerequisites: None.
approve(address,uint256): Sets the allowance for a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller. | Prerequisites: The spender cannot be the zero address.
transferFrom(address,address,uint256): Transfers tokens from one account to another using the allowance mechanism. | Prerequisites: The sender must have a balance of at least the amount being transferred, and the caller must have allowance for the sender's tokens of at least the amount.
increaseAllowance(address,uint256): Increases the allowance for a spender by a specified amount. | Prerequisites: The spender cannot be the zero address.
decreaseAllowance(address,uint256): Decreases the allowance for a spender by a specified amount. | Prerequisites: The spender cannot be the zero address, and the allowance must be sufficient.
mint(uint256): Creates new tokens and assigns them to the caller's account. | Prerequisites: Only the owner can call this function.
burn(uint256): Burns a specified amount of tokens from the caller's account. | Prerequisites: The caller must have at least the amount of tokens to burn.
owner(): Returns the address of the current owner of the contract. | Prerequisites: None.
renounceOwnership(): Removes the ownership of the contract. | Prerequisites: Only the owner can call this function.
transferOwnership(address): Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account. | Prerequisites: Only the owner can call this function, and the new owner cannot be the zero address.

EXTRACT_ACTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a helpful assistant. Below is a description of a smart contract (including its functions, prerequisites, etc.). Based on this description, generate an array of JSON objects where each object represents an on-chain action corresponding to one of the contractâ€™s functions. 

The JSON objects should follow this structure:

[
  {
    "type": "<string>",
    "params": {
      // any parameters needed to call the function
    },
    "label": "<string>",
    "desc": "<string>",
    "message": "<string>"
  },
  ...
]

**Guidelines:**
1. Each contract function should produce exactly one JSON object (unless you want to exclude view/pure functions like `decimals()`, `symbol()`, etc.).
2. `type`: Always fill in "button".
3. `params`: Include two keys: method name (function name without the input types) and Prerequisites.
4. `label`: A short, user-friendly label for the action.
5. `desc`: A brief description of what the function does.
6. `message`: A short message in the tone of the user for expressing the willingness to perform the action on the contract with their own wallet. 
7. Include only valid JSON in the response; do not add additional explanatory text or markdown outside the JSON.

Here is the contract description:
